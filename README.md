# Project-2
Project 1 for CSCI-E15 is a simple Portfolio.

## Live URL
<http://p2.legislatron.com> (Just reusing old domain I own)

## Description
This project uses PHP to generate a highly memorable passphrase of 3-5 words long. This is because a passphrase of 1 word defeats the purpose and 2 isn't as interesting or memorable as 3. 


## Demo

## Details for teaching team
This is a passphrase generator. It will not generate a singular password! This is by design.

## Outside code
* Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/
* There is commented out Google Image Search API that I decided not to implement.
